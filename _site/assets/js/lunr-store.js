By analysing information held in healthcare records and medical tests, we aim to produce personalised assessments of the risk of future stroke, enabling healthcare professionals to offer treatment to reduce this risk.

Made up of academic clinicians, data scientists and governance experts, it aims to leverage the unique demographics, geography and healthcare infrastructure of the South West Peninsula to produce data driven solutions to unmet healthcare needs. This means developing technologies which allow earlier diagnosis, enable disease risk stratification and/or improve patient safety. Our projects, which span a range of disease areas, are selected because they have a high chance of making a rapid impact on patient care. Central to our work is the use of routinely collected healthcare data in a transparent, safe and secure manner. We use this data to enable development of models (often using Artificial Intelligence or other advanced bioinformatic/statistical techniques) to improve the performance of healthcare systems, allowing cheaper, better care for patients. To enable this, we have developed a strategic network of collaborators and supporters across the South West Peninsula of the United Kingdom. This network draws on expertise in the academic, healthcare and commercial sectors, to enable development of technologies in the most rapid and efficient way possible. We hope that our work will improve the delivery of healthcare and add to the economic prosperity of the region and the UK."

        "text": "Our research relies on use of routinely collected data, that is information collected in clinical records and healthcare investigations as part of the delivery of care. This data has the potential to dramatically improve the health of the UK population. We also recognise the key importance of using such data in a transparent, compliant and secure manner. Where it is feasible, we will seek explicit consent from the owners of that data. Where there are good reasons why this is not possible, we use the following processes and principles to ensure use of the data is legal, ethical and serves a genuine public interest: ### Anonymisation All the data which we use will be in anonymised form. All the data we extract from the NHS will be de-identified. We will never knowingly pass data which includes information which can be used to identify the people it relates to outside of the NHS. ### Consultation Our projects are co-designed by people with lived experience of the disease. Their views and (where appropriate) the views of the general public are incorporated into our work. We disseminate accessible information about our our projects prior to acquiring any data, to allow people the opportunity to [opt out]({% link pages/optout.md%}) of the use of their data. We will ensure that anyone who has joined the [NHS England data opt out register](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-data-opt-out) is not included in our research. ### Ethical approval All our research is reviewed and approved by a [local](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/governance/research-ethics-policy) (University of Plymouth) and [national](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/approvals-amendments/what-approvals-do-i-need/research-ethics-committee-review/) (Health Research Authority) ethical review board. Where our projects involve the transfer of identifiable data outside of the routine care team, data is reviewed by the [Confidentiality Advisory Group](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/committees-and-services/confidentiality-advisory-group/) of the Health Research Authority. ### Data minimisation We will always use the minimum amount of data we require to deliver the aims of the project. ### Data security When extracting identifiable patient data, where possible we will collate and link our databases within the routine care team (the people who would have access to that data as part of their role in delivering clinical care). This is possible because many of our team have combined roles as researchers and NHS professionals. All identifiable data (data which contains information such as name or date of birth) is handled solely on NHS computer systems. Before data is passed to University researchers (or in some cases, if relevant governance and patient/public consultation is in place, external partners), it is fully deidentified and audited, to ensure it is not possible to identify individual subjects within it."

He has a life-long interest in combining biomedical and computer sciences, and believes we're now living in the age that he so looked forward to - where computer science ('AI') is matching biomedical science in what it can offer to medicine. Currently his work mostly involves looking at variation in healthcare between hospitals, looking at what different hospitals do differently, and how that affects patient outcomes. He uses modelling and AI to ask the question \"What would happen if my patient went to another hospital? What would they do, and what would the patient outcome be?\" {% endcapture %} {% include person.html name=\"Michael Allen\" image=\"/assets/img/Michael_Allen.jpg\" introduction=intro_michael_allen %}"
