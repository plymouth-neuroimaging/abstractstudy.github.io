            <h3>PHASE I - model training</h3>
            <p>Funded by a grant from the UKRI <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/">Medical Research
                    Council</a>, we are
                currently building a database of anonymised information drawn from health records and medical tests
                libraries of University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust. This will comprise 10,000 people who have had a
                stroke and up to 110,000 people who have not. We think this will allow us to generate sophisticated
                estimates of the future risk of stroke at 1,3, 5 and 10 years. Using techniques known as ‘explainable
                AI’, we also hope to be able to identify new markers of future stroke, which will may enable new
                treatments to be developed</p>

            <h3>PHASE II - External Validation</h3>
            <p>In order to ensure the predictions our model is making are accurate, we plan to test whether it can
                accurately predict stroke in populations representing the diversity of the United Kingdom. This will
                involve building new datasets extracted from other UK Healthcare providers and applying the model to
                them to see if it works. </p>

            <h3>PHASE III</h3>
            <p>Having engaged with stroke survivors, carers, members of the public and healthcare professionals to
                understand the best way to communicate the predictions made in the model, we hope to use them to target
                personalized treatments to reduce the risk of future stroke. </p>
