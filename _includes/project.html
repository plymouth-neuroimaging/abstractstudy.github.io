        A stroke is a sudden loss of oxygen to the brain, caused by a clot blocking the blood supply or a bleed within
        the brain itself.

        We know that in many cases, the information necessary to predict a future stroke is present in medical tests
        undertaken for other reasons, however, often healthcare professionals do not have the time to look for and act
        on this information.

        Moreover, around XX% of the strokes cannot be explained by known risk factors for stroke.

                <p>We believe that Artificial Intelligence technologies may allow us to automatically detect those at
                    higher
                    risk of stroke, by identifying patterns within these investigations which predict a stroke. These
                    patterns
                    may allow us to identify new and known risk factors. We hope to create an artificial intelligence
                    ‘model’
                    which will analyse health records and and medical tests, to create a tailored, personal assessment
                    of
                    stroke
                    risk. This will allow treatments which reduce this risk to be started and, we hope, new treatments
                    to be
                    developed.

            <p>Funded by a grant from the UKRI <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/">Medical Research
                    Council</a>, we are
                currently building a database of anonymised information drawn from health records and medical tests
                libraries of University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust. This will comprise 10,000 people who have had
                a
                stroke and up to 110,000 people who have not. We think this will allow us to generate sophisticated
                estimates of the future risk of stroke at 1,3, 5 and 10 years. Using techniques known as
                ‘explainable
                AI’, we also hope to be able to identify new markers of future stroke, which will may enable new
                treatments to be developed</p>

            <h3>PHASE II - External Validation</h3>
            <p>In order to ensure the predictions our model is making are accurate, we plan to test whether it can
                accurately predict stroke in populations representing the diversity of the United Kingdom. This will
                involve building new datasets extracted from other UK Healthcare providers and applying the model to
                them to see if it works. </p>

            <h3>PHASE III</h3>
            <p>Having engaged with stroke survivors, carers, members of the public and healthcare professionals to
                understand the best way to communicate the predictions made in the model, we hope to use them to
                target
                personalized treatments to reduce the risk of future stroke. </p>
