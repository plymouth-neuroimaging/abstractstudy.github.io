A stroke is a sudden loss of oxygen to the brain, caused by a clot blocking the blood supply or a bleed within the brain itself. Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the UK and worldwide, but research suggests that, if known risk factors for stroke were treated. Around 1 in 10 of strokes could be prevented and 3 in 10 strokes are unexplained. 

We know that in many cases, the information necessary to predict a future stroke is present in medical tests undertaken for other reasons, however, often healthcare professionals do not have the time to look for and act on this information. Moreover, around XX% of the strokes cannot be explained by known risk factors for stroke. 

We believe that Artificial Intelligence technologies may allow us to automatically detect those at higher risk of stroke, by identifying patterns within these investigations which predict a stroke. These patterns may allow us to identify new and known risk factors. We hope to create an artificial intelligence ‘model’ which will analyse health records and and medical tests, to create a tailored, personal assessment of stroke risk. This will allow treatments which reduce this risk to be started and, we hope, new treatments to be developed.
