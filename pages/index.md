 <div style="font-size: 20px;">ABSTRACT</div> is a pioneering research study which aims to use the power of Artificial Intelligence to make better predictions about who will develop a stroke in the future. By analysing information held in healthcare records and medical tests, we aim to produce personalised assessments of the risk of future stroke, enabling healthcare professionals to offer treatment to reduce this risk.
